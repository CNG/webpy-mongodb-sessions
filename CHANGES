v0.2dev, 2010-12-14
-------------------
* Made storage of session data inside MongoDB less opaque: the "data" field
  is now a dict whose values are only pickled if they need to be. An
  accompanying migration facilitates upgrading from 0.1.

* collection_name now defaults to 'sessions'

v0.1dev, 2010-11-11
-------------------

* Steven Anderson's http://github.com/whilefalse/webpy-mongodb-sessions
