A SessionStore class that allows you to use web.py sessions with MongoDB.

To setup:

    from session import MongoStore
    from pymongo import Connection
 
    #First get a MongoDB database object
    c = Connection()
    db = c.webpy

    #Create a new session object, passing the db and collection name to the MongoStore object
    session = web.session.Session(app, MongoStore(db, 'sessions'))

 
To use:
   
    You can now use the `session` object as you would do with normal web.py sessions (http://webpy.org/cookbook/sessions).
